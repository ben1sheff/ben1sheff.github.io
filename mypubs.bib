	abstract = {Supersymmetric extensions of the Standard Model with scalar superpartners above 10 TeV are well motivated since the Higgs boson mass can be explained by quantum corrections while maintaining gauge coupling unification. If supersymmetry breaking is transmitted to gauginos via anomaly mediation, the gaugino masses are loop suppressed compared to scalar masses, and the lightest supersymmetric particle is the Higgsino or wino, which can be the dark matter. In this setup, we identify the regions of parameter space that reproduce the observed Higgs boson mass and the thermal abundance of dark matter. We analyze the effects of complex phases in the gaugino mass parameters on the electron electric dipole moment (EDM) and the dark matter scattering cross section. We find that, for scalar masses up to 10 PeV and any size of the complex phases, the model with Higgsino dark matter is within reach of planned experiments -- Advanced ACME via electron EDM and LUX-ZEPLIN via dark matter direct detection -- with complementary discovery potentials, and the model with wino dark matter is within reach of future electron EDM experiments.},

	abstract = {Split higgsinos are a compelling class of models to explain dark matter and may be on the verge of detection by multiple current experimental avenues. The idea is based on a large split in scales between the electroweak scale and decoupled scalars, with relatively light higgsinos between the two. Such models enjoy the merit of depending on very few parameters while still explaining gauge coupling unification, dark matter, and most of the hierarchy between the Planck and electroweak scales, and they remain undetected by past experiments. We analyze split higgsinos in view of current and next generation experiments. We discuss the direct and indirect detection prospects and further demonstrate promising discovery potentials in the upcoming electron electric dipole moment experiments. The parameter space of this model is analyzed in terms of experiments expected to run in the coming years and where we should be looking for the next potential discoveries.},
