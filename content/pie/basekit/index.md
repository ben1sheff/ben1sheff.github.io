Project Manager for designing the base kit for the 2016 robotics competition season. In the course of this project, considered different improvements to previous yearsâ€™ base kits, from different motors, to metals.
We built two moving robots, each testing a linear combination of possible improvements to be made.
The designs were then evaluated on the basis of destructive testing, budget and sourcing, and modularity for potential student designs, to make a single, conglomerate robot.
