      title: Pioneers in Engineering
      text: From 2013 to 2017, I worked with Pioneers in Engineering (PiE) to bring a robotics competiton to underserved high schools in the Bay Area. We designed, sourced, and manufactured parts with an eye to the ease with which students could build their ideas, and to making the competition affordable.
