abstract: Supersymmetric extensions of the Standard Model with scalar superpartners
  above 10 TeV are well motivated since the Higgs boson mass can be explained by quantum
  corrections while maintaining gauge coupling unification. If supersymmetry breaking
  is transmitted to gauginos via anomaly mediation, the gaugino masses are loop suppressed
  compared to scalar masses, and the lightest supersymmetric particle is the Higgsino
  or wino, which can be the dark matter. In this setup, we identify the regions of
  parameter space that reproduce the observed Higgs boson mass and the thermal abundance
  of dark matter. We analyze the effects of complex phases in the gaugino mass parameters
  on the electron electric dipole moment (EDM) and the dark matter scattering cross
  section. We find that, for scalar masses up to 10 PeV and any size of the complex
  phases, the model with Higgsino dark matter is within reach of planned experiments
  -- Advanced ACME via electron EDM and LUX-ZEPLIN via dark matter direct detection
  -- with complementary discovery potentials, and the model with wino dark matter
  is within reach of future electron EDM experiments.
