abstract: Split higgsinos are a compelling class of models to explain dark matter
  and may be on the verge of detection by multiple current experimental avenues. The
  idea is based on a large split in scales between the electroweak scale and decoupled
  scalars, with relatively light higgsinos between the two. Such models enjoy the
  merit of depending on very few parameters while still explaining gauge coupling
  unification, dark matter, and most of the hierarchy between the Planck and electroweak
  scales, and they remain undetected by past experiments. We analyze split higgsinos
  in view of current and next generation experiments. We discuss the direct and indirect
  detection prospects and further demonstrate promising discovery potentials in the
  upcoming electron electric dipole moment experiments. The parameter space of this
  model is analyzed in terms of experiments expected to run in the coming years and
  where we should be looking for the next potential discoveries.
