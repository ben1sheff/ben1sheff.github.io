      I studied the foundational concept of neural networks and deep learning. By the end, I was familiar with the significant technological trends driving the rise of deep learning; build, train, and apply fully connected deep neural networks; implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks; identify key parameters in a neural network’s architecture; and apply deep learning to your own applications.

    summary: |
      Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me

Benjamin Sheff is a postdoctoral researcher at with the high energy theory group at the University of Utah Department of Physics and Astronomy. His past research focuses on forming testable predictions to confront theories for physics beyond the Standard Model with data. He has worked primarily with variations of Supersymmetric models with Higgsino-like and Wino-like Dark Matter, narrowing the available parameter space using results from direct detection experiments, electron EDM measurements, indirect detection through gamma ray and neutrino telescopes, and Higgs mass measurements.

Going forward, he is interested in leveraging this experience in physical system intuition, modeling, and data handling to further the field of AI engineering, with a particular interest in robot learning.
