      - Developed software pipelines to take physics model parameters and output spectra to compare to telescope data using Feynrules, MicrOmegas, and PPPC4DMID. This streamlined parameter exploration, excluded a range of Dark Matter models, and motivated future studies at experiments like IceCube. 
      - Constructed a weighted graph of 1.5 billion stars, amassed and analyzed using SQL-based code on a Slurm-based computing cluster. Using scikit-learn, I clustered this graph, finding 1073 potential bound star groups. 
      - Mentored a post-baccalaureate student who was later accepted as a full graduate student for the University of Utah physics program. Our project focused on evaluating general Supersymmetric models of new physics with indirect detection tools such as MadHat.
      - Developed a budget for and ran a journal club for two years. Facilitated discussion to develop new ideas for projects and built research and presentation skills for junior researchers.
      - Constructed physics models including new particles designed to explain known anomalies. Built models with light neutralinos or particles with relatively small electric charge that explained the observed dark matter among other anomalies.
      - Taught as a substitute for undergraduate sustainability course, covering fundamentals of energy in Newtonian and fluid mechanics, and in electrical systems.

      - Using Supersymmetry techniques, developed models with light neutralinos that explained the observed dark matter abundance and the hierarchy problem.
      - Managed a project overseeing a postdoc, building a software pipeline taking model parameters and generating experimental predictions by connecting Feynrules, MicrOmegas, SUSYHD, and our own scripts. This made fast parameter scans, excluding a range of Dark Matter models, motivating experiments like Advanced ACME. 
      - Designed new features using Monte Carlo detector simulations to optimize for classification of events with scalar particles in the ATLAS detector. These features improved classification efficiency up to 50x in such particle searches. 
      - Developed, along with the DIALUP group, a new set of labs and a course plan for the introductory mechanics lab for engineers, encouraging a focus on developing useful coding and statistical skills.
      - Taught Introductory Mechanics lab course for two sections each semester for four semesters, and the Modern Physics lab course for two sections each of two semesters.
      - Treasurer for the Physics Graduate Student Council, managing finances and projecting budget requests to the department along with taking part in organizing game nights and weekly coffee hours for community building

## About Me

Benjamin Sheff is a postdoctoral researcher at with the high energy theory group at the University of Utah Department of Physics and Astronomy. His past research focuses on forming testable predictions to confront theories for physics beyond the Standard Model with data. He has worked primarily with variations of Supersymmetric models with Higgsino-like and Wino-like Dark Matter, narrowing the available parameter space using results from direct detection experiments, electron EDM measurements, indirect detection through gamma ray and neutrino telescopes, and Higgs mass measurements.

Going forward, he is interested in leveraging this experience in physical system intuition, modeling, and data handling to further the field of AI engineering and robotics, with a particular interest in robot learning.
