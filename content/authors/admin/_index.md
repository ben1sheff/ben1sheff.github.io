      - Conducted feature engineering on large scale data from the Gaia telescope, generated pairwise likelihoods for star gravitational binding for globular clusters and dwarf galaxies.
      - Mentored a post-baccalaureate student who was later accepted as a full graduate student for the University of Utah physics program. Our project focused on evaluating general Supersymmetric models of new physics with indirect detection tools such as MadHat.
      - Developed a budget for and ran a journal club for two years. Facilitated discussion to develop new ideas for projects and built research and presentation skills for junior researchers.
      - Constructed physics models including new particles designed to explain known anomalies. Built models with light neutralinos or particles with relatively small electric charge that explained the observed dark matter among other anomalies.
      - Designed and coded software pipelines combining existing Python, Mathematica, and Fortran packages along with my own script to conduct scans over orders of magnitude of particle masses in parameter space, comparing predictions to known experimental limits, such as neutrino detection, the Higgs boson mass, and direct detection experiments

      I studied the foundational concept of neural networks and deep learning. By the end, I was familiar with the significant technological trends driving the rise of deep learning; build, train, and apply fully connected deep neural networks; implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks; identify key parameters in a neural network’s architecture; and apply deep learning to your own applications.

    summary: |
      Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me

Benjamin Sheff is a postdoctoral researcher at with the high energy theory group at the University of Utah Department of Physics and Astronomy. His past research focuses on forming testable predictions to confront theories for physics beyond the Standard Model with data. He has worked primarily with variations of Supersymmetric models with Higgsino-like and Wino-like Dark Matter, narrowing the available parameter space using results from direct detection experiments, electron EDM measurements, indirect detection through gamma ray and neutrino telescopes, and Higgs mass measurements.

Going forward, he is interested in leveraging this experience in physical system intuition, modeling, and data handling to further the field of AI engineering, with a particular interest in robot learning.
