I designed and constructed a modular jig for testing light detector components in our cryostat. Careful consideration was taken with the larger number of components this jig had compared to earlier jigs that interfaces would remain coupled tightly enough to thermalize at low temperatures, and clamps would hold as different materials shrank. The design was built to be modular, allowing a variety of options for light sources, light detectors, and other configurations.
