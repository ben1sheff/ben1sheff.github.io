      <title>Light Detector Test Jig</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I designed and constructed a modular jig for testing light detector components in our cryostat. Careful consideration was taken with the larger number of components this jig had compared to earlier jigs that interfaces would remain coupled tightly enough to thermalize at low temperatures, and clamps would hold as different materials shrank. The design was built to be modular, allowing a variety of options for light sources, light detectors, and other configurations.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Shielded TES testing jig</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I designed and made CAD models for shielded jigs Transition Edge Sensor (TES) testing. These were designed with a niobium can shield designed to superconduct at cryostat temperatures (circa 10 mK).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I designed, made CAD models for, and built shielded test jigs for Transition Edge Sensor (TES) development. These had to take special care of material and thermalization concerns to properly cool to 10 mK. Fully shielded jigs were &lt;a href=http://localhost:1313/cuore/tesshielded/&gt;designed later&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Worm Gearbox Design</title>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/pie/wormgear/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Worked on a team designing a worm gearbox to be manufactured and distributed to over 25 teams. We ran through the full production cycle, including CADing the gearbox, sourcing the parts, running through destructive testing, and manufacturing the main box ourselves&lt;/p&gt;</description>
