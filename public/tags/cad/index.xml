      <guid>http://localhost:1313/project/cabinet/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Designed a cabinet for ease of use and transportation of game pieces. We made a full CAD model and machined and finished the wood, along with machining and affixing the metal, and plastic pieces ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Light Detector Test Jig</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/cuore/lightdetectorjig/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I designed and constructed a modular jig for testing light detector components in our cryostat. Careful consideration was taken with the larger number of components this jig had compared to earlier jigs that interfaces would remain coupled tightly enough to thermalize at low temperatures, and clamps would hold as different materials shrank. The design was built to be modular, allowing a variety of options for light sources, light detectors, and other configurations.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Project Manager for designing the base kit for the 2016 robotics competition season. In the course of this project, considered different improvements to previous yearsâ€™ base kits, from different motors, to metals.
We built two moving robots, each testing a linear combination of possible improvements to be made.
The designs were then evaluated on the basis of destructive testing, budget and sourcing, and modularity for potential student designs, to make a single, conglomerate robot.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Shielded TES testing jig</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I designed and made CAD models for shielded jigs Transition Edge Sensor (TES) testing. These were designed with a niobium can shield designed to superconduct at cryostat temperatures (circa 10 mK).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I designed, made CAD models for, and built shielded test jigs for Transition Edge Sensor (TES) development. These had to take special care of material and thermalization concerns to properly cool to 10 mK. Fully shielded jigs were &lt;a href=http://localhost:1313/cuore/tesshielded/&gt;designed later&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <pubDate>Mon, 04 Nov 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/pie/wormgear/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Worked on a team designing a worm gearbox to be manufactured and distributed to over 25 teams. We ran through the full production cycle, including CADing the gearbox, sourcing the parts, running through destructive testing, and manufacturing the main box ourselves&lt;/p&gt;</description>
